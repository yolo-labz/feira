# Source for the README's headline demo: the phone loop.
#
#   make demo-fone     # re-record and re-render (needs a real phone attached)
#
# This records a REAL run. `feira-fone` talks to a real, Play-certified handset
# over adb and reads the real accessibility tree — nothing here is mocked, and
# the payment refusal at the end is the program refusing, not a printf.
#
# What IS a stand-in is the shop: docs/assets/source/vitrine-fixture.html, a
# fake storefront serving the same example items as template/. Recording against
# a real delivery app would mean opening somebody's account, with their address
# and their order history, on camera — and driving a third party's app to make a
# promotional asset. The fixture keeps the demo honest about the tool while
# keeping a real household out of it.
#
# Prerequisites, all checked below so the recording fails loudly instead of
# silently producing a broken GIF:
#   - one phone attached, in `device` state
#   - the fixture served and open in the phone's browser
#   - ANDROID_SERIAL pinned
#
# As with demo.sh, each command is printed rather than run from a real prompt,
# so the cast carries no hostname, username or $PWD. The serial is masked for
# the same reason: this phone is reached over a private network, and its address
# is infrastructure, not something a README needs to publish.
